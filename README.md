# static-gen
This is the static site generator for my website, which in a very short time has experienced an excessive number of transformations transformations. It started out as a Django project, migrated to Pelican, and then I wanted to try making a simple static site generator with as few depenencies as possible for myself. So here we are.

It doesn't need a server, it doesn't have 10+ dependencies, it doesn't have multiple methods of doing the same thing that conflict with eachother in unexpected ways.

It's simply ran with `python build` and currently throws together my site in fractions of a second.

Now run `python sglmr -r -l` to serve the site and autoreload when changes are detected.
